# Windows Validation Attempt - 2026-06-16

## Summary

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Validator: Codex
- Result: blocked
- Scope attempted: real Windows validation preflight

At the time of this attempt, CI coverage had not yet been added. Today, GitHub Actions covers the shared Go checks, EQ8 web build, and Windows smoke script, but that still does not replace a real Windows host pass.

## Environment

- Host OS: Darwin
- Host architecture: arm64
- `go env GOHOSTOS`: darwin
- `go env GOHOSTARCH`: arm64
- `go env GOOS`: darwin
- `go env GOARCH`: arm64

## Preconditions Checked

- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`: not found
- `wine64`: not found

## Command Attempted

### `bash scripts/preflight_windows_vst3.sh`

- Result: failed
- Reason: no Windows-capable C compiler available on this machine

```text
no Windows-capable C compiler found
tried:
  - x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc: not found
  - /usr/bin/clang: missing <windows.h>
  - /usr/bin/cc: missing <windows.h>
```

### `bash scripts/windows_toolchain_smoke.sh`

- Result: passed
- Notes: script-level regression coverage still works on this non-Windows host, and CI now covers the same smoke path, but neither satisfies the real Windows validation requirement.

## Decision

Real Windows validation remains blocked until the work is moved to a real Windows `amd64` machine with:

- MinGW-w64 on `PATH`
- WebView2 SDK headers and loader library
- WebView2 runtime
- at least one Windows VST3 host

Use `docs/windows-validation.md` and `docs/windows-validation-report-template.md` for the next real validation run.
